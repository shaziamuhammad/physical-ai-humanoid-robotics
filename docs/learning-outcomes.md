## Skills Mastered at the End of the Quarter

Upon successful completion of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics capstone project, participants will have mastered the following key skills and knowledge areas:

-   **Physical AI Concepts:** Understand the fundamental differences between digital and physical AI, embodied intelligence, and the unique challenges of operating AI systems in the real world.
-   **ROS 2 Basics:** Develop and integrate robotic components using the ROS 2 framework, including nodes, topics, services, and actions.
-   **Simulation with Gazebo/Unity:** Create and utilize high-fidelity digital twins of robotic systems using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for advanced visualization and interaction.
-   **Sensor Integration and Emulation:** Understand and implement data pipelines for common robotic sensors such as LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs in simulated environments.
-   **NVIDIA Isaac Workflow:** Set up and leverage NVIDIA Isaac Sim for AI-driven robotics simulation, synthetic data generation, and collaborative development.
-   **AI Perception with Isaac ROS:** Implement and apply Isaac ROS packages for visual SLAM (VSLAM) and other perception tasks to enable robots to understand their surroundings.
-   **Humanoid Navigation with Nav2:** Adapt and utilize the Nav2 framework for complex path planning and autonomous navigation specifically tailored for humanoid robots.
-   **VLA (Vision-Language-Action) Reasoning:** Architect and develop VLA agents capable of interpreting natural language commands, perceiving visual information, and executing physical actions in the real world.
-   **Ethical Robotics Development:** Analyze and address the ethical implications, safety considerations, and responsible development practices associated with Physical AI and humanoid robotics.
-   **Project Management and Collaboration:** Apply effective project management techniques and collaborate in a team environment to deliver a complex robotics project.
-   **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:** Create clear, concise, and academically structured documentation for technical concepts, suitable for knowledge transfer and future AI integration.
