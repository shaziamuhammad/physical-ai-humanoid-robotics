## Key Differences Between Digital AI and Embodied Intelligence

### Environmental Interaction

**Digital AI** operates in virtual environments where:
- Conditions can be perfectly controlled
- Variables can be isolated
- Experiments can be repeated identically
- Environmental factors are predictable

**Embodied Intelligence** must navigate real environments where:
- Conditions are constantly changing
- Multiple variables interact simultaneously
- Each situation is unique
- Environmental factors are unpredictable

### Learning and Adaptation

**Digital AI** typically learns from:
- Large, pre-collected datasets
- Supervised learning with labeled examples
- Simulated environments with known outcomes
- Batch processing of historical data

**Embodied Intelligence** learns through:
- Real-time interaction with the environment
- Trial-and-error exploration
- Immediate feedback from physical actions
- Continuous adaptation to changing conditions

### Sensorimotor Integration

**Digital AI** often has:
